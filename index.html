 <h2>Shae-Marie Small</h2>
 <p>I am a Barbadian third-year student pursuing my bachelorâ€™s degree in Actuarial Science. Although I am in my third year, I am still undecided about which path I will take. However, I consider myself to be someone who aspires to greatness. I have always had a fascination with programming, and I believe that Web Development will allow me to pursue that passion.
